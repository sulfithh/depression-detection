<h1><u>DIET PLANS</u></h1><br><br>
<h3>Dark Chocolate</h3><br><br>
<img src="../static/diet_images/dark.jpg" height="300px" width="300px"><br><br>
<p>Usually, dessert isn’t a good choice when you’re stressed, but dark chocolate may be an exception. This treat could help reduce stress in two ways — via its chemical impact and its emotional impact. Chocolate feels like such an indulgence that it can be a real treat to simply savor a piece of it, and that feeling alone can help reduce stress, says Meyerowitz. Dark chocolate, which is also rich in antioxidants, can also lower levels of stress hormones in the body, according to a Swiss study published in theJournal of Proteome Research in which participants had eaten about 1.5 ounces (oz) of the treat per day for two weeks. Just be sure to avoid excess calories in your diet by not overindulging in chocolate, advises Meyerowitz. Keep serving size in mind with dark chocolate, as the calories can add up quickly. Stick to a 1-oz serving or less of at least 60 percent cacao dark chocolate daily.

<h3>Whole-Grain Carbohydrates</h3><br><br>

<p>Low-carb keto diet followers, take note: The right carbs can act as stress busters! According to MIT, carbohydrates can increase levels of serotonin, a chemical in the body that helps boost mood and reduce stress. More serotonin means more concentration and a more productive workday. But picking the right carbs is critical. Refined carbs — such as chips, cookies, and crackers — are tied to inflammation, stress, and depression, according to a May 2010 study in Psychosomatic Medicine. These carbs may also raise your blood pressure, straining your heart health, suggests a 2016 review in Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases, and lead you to overeat later in the day, other research suggests. Complex carbs, on the other hand, can do wonders for your stress levels because they digest more slowly and keep blood sugar levels more even, according to Harvard Medical School. Sources of complex carbs include sweet potatoes and whole grains (such as whole-grain bread, quinoa, brown rice, and steel-cut or old-fashioned oats).

Heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids in whole fish like tuna, halibut, salmon, and sardines may help ease depression, suggests a September 2015 review in Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health. Lowering overall stress and anxiety is another possible benefit, according to a study in the August 2015 Clinical Psychopharmacology and Neuroscience.

1. Good for your heart: A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition shows that regular consumption of fatty fish lowered triglycerides by 25 to 30 per cent.  Studies have also shown that consumption of fatty fish may help in lower the risk of heart attack and stroke.

2. High in nutrients: Fatty fish is high in important nutrients such as Vitamin D and protein.

3. Protects your brain: Consumption of fatty fish may protect your brain from age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. It is known to slower rates of cognitive decline.  Certain studies have shown that people who eat fish regularly have more grey matter in their brain centers that control emotions and memory.

4. Boosts mood and keeps depression at bay: Omega-3 fatty acids in these kinds of fish are known to boost your mood and keep the risk of depression at bay. Fatty fish have the feel good factor that leaves you happy and satisfied.  Some studies have shown that people who eat fatty fish or consume Omega-3 fatty acids regularly may be less likely to get depressed.

<p>Your mom might’ve been onto something when she made you drink all your milk at the dinner table. Turns out, calcium might not only strengthen your skeleton — it could also brighten your mood. A December 2012 study in Nutrition Research and Practice found that Korean women who consumed the least calcium reporting feeling the most depressed. Milk and other dairy with calcium and added vitamin D can help muscles relax and stabilize mood; a January 2017 study in Obstetrics & Gynecology Science suggests these nutrients may even ease symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, which we ladies know can definitely crank up the stress!

Nuts are a boon to your health in more ways than one. First, they’re satiating, meaning they can help ward off unhealthy cravings. Second, they could help lower blood pressure, according to a July 2012 study in Hypertension, which focused on pistachios. And third, Meyerowitz says, their B vitamins have been shown to help lower stress levels. Just remember to reach for only a small handful, as nuts are calorie dense and can lead to weight gain if you eat too many.

<img src="../static/diet_images/c.jpg" height="300px" width="300px"><br><br>
<p>Vitamin C will not only ward off scurvy — the nutrient can also keep stress at bay. One small randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study published in Psychopharmacology found that when people took 3,000 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C in a slow-release formula each day, their cortisol levels, and overall stress, decreased. Eating citrus fruits, including oranges, grapefruit, and strawberries, is a good start, but you would need a supplement to reach such high levels of these nutrients. Speak with your doctor before adding vitamin C supplements to your diet.

As mentioned, vitamins C and B6 can help reduce stress, and the fruit’s potassium may help lower blood pressure. Not to mention, the healthy fat and fiber in avocados can help contribute to satiety, discouraging you from unhealthy snacking when you’re stressed, suggests an April 2017 study in The FASEB Journal.

<p>You might think desk salads are boring, but for lowering stress, they may be one of the best choices you can make at lunchtime. Leafy-green vegetables, such as spinach and kale, as well as other raw fruits and veggies, are stress-busting powerhouses, as described in an April 2018 study in Frontiers in Psychology. As a rich source of magnesium, leafy greens can help regulate cortisol and blood pressure levels. Plus, green leafy veggies contain folate, which plays a key role in the production of the feel-good chemical dopamine.
